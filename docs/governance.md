# Governance

The PiSphere project is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which enables community-driven decision-making and ensures the integrity of the system.

## Proposal Creation

1. Users create proposals through the client interface, specifying the description, funding requirements, and other relevant details.
2. Proposals are stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.

## Voting

1. Users vote on proposals using their tokens, with each token representing a single vote.
2. Voting is done through the client interface, with users able to view proposal details and cast their votes.
3. Voting results are stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and accuracy.

## Fund Management

1. The multi-signature wallet is used to manage funds allocated to approved proposals.
2. Funds are released to proposal creators upon successful completion of the project.
