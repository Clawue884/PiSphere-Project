# Architecture

The PiSphere project is designed to be a decentralized ecosystem, comprising multiple components that work together to provide a secure, scalable, and user-friendly environment for digital currency and decentralized applications (dApps).

## Components

### 1. Smart Contracts

* **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) Contract**: Manages governance proposals, voting, and fund management.
* **Multi-Signature Wallet Contract**: Enhances security for governance proposals and fund management.
* **Upgradable Contracts**: Utilize proxy patterns to allow for seamless contract upgrades.

### 2. Backend

* **Server**: Built using Node.js and Express.js, responsible for handling API requests and interacting with the blockchain.
* **Database**: Utilizes MongoDB for storing user data, proposal information, and other relevant data.

### 3. Frontend

* **Client**: Built using React, provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the DAO, creating proposals, and voting.
* **WebSocket Integration**: Enables real-time updates on transactions and proposals.

### 4. Blockchain

* **Ethereum Network**: Utilizes the Ethereum blockchain for smart contract deployment and execution.

## Data Flow

1. Users interact with the client, creating proposals or voting on existing ones.
2. The client sends requests to the server, which interacts with the blockchain.
3. The blockchain executes smart contract logic, updating the state of the DAO and multi-signature wallet.
4. The server retrieves updated data from the blockchain and stores it in the database.
5. The client receives real-time updates through WebSocket integration, reflecting the current state of the DAO and proposals.

## Benefits

* **Decentralized Governance**: Community-driven decision-making process.
* **Security**: Multi-signature wallet and upgradable contracts ensure the integrity of the system.
* **Scalability**: Designed to handle a large number of users and proposals.
* **User-Friendly**: Intuitive interface for users to interact with the DAO.
