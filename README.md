# PiSphere Project

## Overview
PiSphere is a decentralized ecosystem designed to empower users through a community-driven blockchain platform. This project aims to create a secure, scalable, and user-friendly environment for digital currency and decentralized applications (dApps). 

## Features

- **Decentralized Governance**: Managed through a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) with voting mechanisms, allowing community members to participate in decision-making processes.

- **Multi-Signature Wallet**: Enhanced security for governance proposals and fund management, ensuring that multiple parties must approve transactions before they are executed.

- **Upgradable Smart Contracts**: Utilize proxy patterns to allow for seamless contract upgrades, enabling the application to evolve without losing state or requiring complex migrations.

- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket integration for real-time notifications on transactions and proposals, ensuring users are always informed of the latest activities.

- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Offline capabilities and improved user experience, allowing users to access the platform even without an internet connection.

- **GraphQL API**: Efficient data fetching and manipulation, providing a flexible and powerful way to interact with the backend services.

- **Oracles Integration**: Fetch real-world data for smart contracts, enabling features like price feeds and other external data dependencies.

- **Automated Testing**: Continuous integration with automated testing for both smart contracts and application code, ensuring high-quality and reliable software through rigorous testing practices.

- **User  Authentication**: Secure user registration and login mechanisms, allowing users to create accounts and manage their profiles.

- **Threaded Discussions**: Support for nested replies in forum threads, enabling more organized and meaningful conversations.

- **Moderation Tools**: Features for moderators to manage content, including the ability to delete threads and ban users.

- **Search Functionality**: Advanced search capabilities to help users find relevant threads and messages quickly.

- **Notifications**: User notifications for replies, mentions, and other important activities within the community.

- **Customizable User Profiles**: Users can personalize their profiles with avatars, bios, and other information.

- **Analytics Dashboard**: Insights into user engagement, popular threads, and community activity to help guide future development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- Truffle (for smart contract development)
- MongoDB (for the backend)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   1 git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/PiSphere-Project.git
   2 cd PiSphere-Project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

- For the client:
   ```bash
   1 cd src/client
   2 npm install
   ```
   
3. **For the server**:
   ```bash
   1 cd ../server
   2 npm install
   ```
   
3. **Set up environment variables**: Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:

   ```plaintext
   1 DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/pisphere
   2 REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```
   
4. **Deploy Smart Contracts**:

   ```bash
   1 truffle migrate --network development

5. **Run the Server**:

   ```bash
   1 cd server
   2 npm start
   ```
   
6. **Run the Client**:

   ```bash
   1 cd ../client
   2 npm start
   ```

## Usage

- Access the application at http://localhost:3000.
- Interact with the DAO to create proposals and vote.
- Use the multi-signature wallet for secure governance.

## Testing
- Run tests for smart contracts:
   ```bash
   1 truffle test
   ```

- Run tests for the server:
   ```bash
   1 cd server
   2 npm test
   ```
